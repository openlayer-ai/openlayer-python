                The model configuration YAML file must contain the following fields:

                - ``name`` : str
                    Name of the model.
                - ``architectureType`` : str
                    The model's framework. Must be one of the supported frameworks
                    on :obj:`ModelType`.
                - ``classNames`` : List[str]
                    List of class names corresponding to the outputs of your predict function.
                    E.g. ``['positive', 'negative']``.
                - ``featureNames`` : List[str], default []
                    List of input feature names. Only applicable if your ``task_type`` is
                    :obj:`TaskType.TabularClassification` or :obj:`TaskType.TabularRegression`.
                - ``categoricalFeatureNames`` : List[str], default []
                    A list containing the names of all categorical features used by the model.
                    E.g. ``["Gender", "Geography"]``. Only applicable if your ``task_type`` is
                    :obj:`TaskType.TabularClassification` or :obj:`TaskType.TabularRegression`.
                - ``metadata`` : Dict[str, any], default {}
                    Dictionary containing metadata about the model. This is the metadata that
                    will be displayed on the Openlayer platform.


        model_package_dir : str, default None
            Path to the directory containing the model package. **Only needed if you are
            interested in adding the model's artifacts.**

            .. admonition:: What's inside `model_package_dir`?

                The model package directory must contain the following files:

                - ``prediction_interface.py``
                    The prediction interface file.
                - ``model artifacts``
                    The model artifacts. This can be a single file or a directory containing
                    multiple files. The model artifacts must be compatible with the
                    prediction interface file.
                - ``requirements.txt``
                    The requirements file. This file contains the dependencies needed to run
                    the prediction interface file.

                For instructions on how to create a model package, refer to
                the documentation.

        sample_data : pd.DataFrame, default None
            Sample data that can be run through the model. **Only needed if  model_package_dir
            is not None**. This data is used to ensure
            the model's prediction interface is compatible with the Openlayer platform.

            .. important::
                The sample_data must be a dataframe with at least two rows.
        force : bool
            If :obj:`add_model` is called when there is already a model in the staging area,
            when ``force=True``, the existing staged model will be overwritten by the new
            one. When ``force=False``, the user will be prompted to confirm the
            overwrite.

        Examples
        --------

        .. seealso::
            Our `sample notebooks
            <https://github.com/openlayer-ai/openlayer-python/tree/main/examples>`_ and
            `tutorials <https://docs.openlayer.com/docs/overview-of-tutorial-tracks>`_.

        First, instantiate the client:

        >>> import openlayer
        >>> client = openlayer.OpenlayerClient('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')

        Create a project if you don't have one:

        >>> from openlayer.tasks import TaskType
        >>> project = client.create_project(
        ...     name="Churn Prediction",
        ...     task_type=TaskType.TabularClassification,
        ...     description="My first project!",
        ... )

        If you already have a project created on the platform:

        >>> project = client.load_project(name="Your project name")

        **If your project's task type is tabular classification...**

        Let's say your model expects to receive a dataset looks like
        the following as input:

        >>> df
            CreditScore  Geography    Balance
        0           618     France     321.92
        1           714    Germany  102001.22
        2           604      Spain   12333.15
        ..          ...        ...        ...

        Then, you can add the model to the project with:

        >>> project.add_model(
        ...     model_config_file_path="path/to/model/config",
        ...     model_package_dir="path/to/model/package")
        ...     sample_data=df.iloc[:5, :],
        ... )

        After adding the model to the project, it is staged, waiting to
        be committed and pushed to the platform. You can check what's on
        your staging area with :obj:`status`. If you want to push the model
        right away with a commit message, you can use the :obj:`commit` and
        :obj:`push` methods:

        >>> project.commit("Initial model commit.")
        >>> project.push()

        **If your task type is text classification...**

        Let's say your dataset looks like the following:

        >>> df
                                      Text
        0    I have had a long weekend
        1    I'm in a fantastic mood today
        2    Things are looking up
        ..                             ...

        Then, you can add the model to the project with:

        >>> project.add_model(
        ...     model_config_file_path="path/to/model/config",
        ...     model_package_dir="path/to/model/package")
        ...     sample_data=df.iloc[:5, :],
        ... )

        After adding the model to the project, it is staged, waiting to
        be committed and pushed to the platform. You can check what's on
        your staging area with :obj:`status`. If you want to push the model
        right away with a commit message, you can use the :obj:`commit` and
        :obj:`push` methods:

        r"""Adds a dataset to a project's staging area (from a csv).

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path : str
            Path to the csv file containing the dataset.
        dataset_config_file_path : str
            Path to the dataset configuration YAML file.

            .. admonition:: What's on the dataset config file?

                The YAML file with the dataset config must have the following fields:

                columnNames : List[str]
                    List of the dataset's column names.
                classNames : List[str]
                    List of class names indexed by label integer in the dataset.
                    E.g. ``[negative, positive]`` when ``[0, 1]`` are in your label column.
                labelColumnName : str
                    Column header in the csv containing the labels.

                    .. important::
                        The labels in this column must be zero-indexed integer values.
                label : str
                    Type of dataset. E.g. ``'training'`` or
                    ``'validation'``.
                featureNames : List[str], default []
                    List of input feature names. Only applicable if your ``task_type`` is
                    :obj:`TaskType.TabularClassification` or :obj:`TaskType.TabularRegression`.
                textColumnName : str, default None
                    Column header in the csv containing the input text. Only applicable if
                    your ``task_type`` is :obj:`TaskType.TextClassification`.
                predictionsColumnName : str, default None
                    Column header in the csv containing the predictions. Only applicable if you
                    are uploading a model as well with the :obj:`add_model` method.

                    .. important::
                        Each cell in this column must contain a list of
                        class probabilities. For example, for a binary classification
                        task, the column with the predictions should look like this:

                        **predictions**

                        ``[0.1, 0.9]``

                        ``[0.8, 0.2]``

                        ``...``

                categoricalFeatureNames : List[str], default []
                    A list containing the names of all categorical features in the dataset.
                    E.g. ``["Gender", "Geography"]``. Only applicable if your ``task_type`` is
                    :obj:`TaskType.TabularClassification` or :obj:`TaskType.TabularRegression`.
                language : str, default 'en'
                    The language of the dataset in ISO 639-1 (alpha-2 code) format.
                sep : str, default ','
                    Delimiter to use. E.g. `'\\t'`.

        force : bool
            If :obj:`add_dataset` is called when there is already a dataset of the same type
            in the staging area, when ``force=True``, the existing staged dataset will be
            overwritten by the new one. When ``force=False``, the user will be prompted
            to confirm the overwrite.

        Notes
        -----
        - Please ensure your input features are strings, ints or floats.
        - Please ensure your label column name is not contained in ``feature_names``.

        Examples
        --------

        First, instantiate the client:

        >>> import openlayer
        >>> client = openlayer.OpenlayerClient('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')

        Create a project if you don't have one:

        >>> from openlayer.tasks import TaskType
        >>> project = client.create_project(
        ...     name="Churn Prediction",
        ...     task_type=TaskType.TabularClassification,
        ...     description="My first project!",
        ... )

        If you already have a project created on the platform:

        >>> project = client.load_project(name="Your project name")

        **If your project's task type is tabular classification...**

        Let's say your dataset looks like the following:

        .. csv-table::
            :header: CreditScore, Geography, Balance, Churned

            618, France, 321.92, 1
            714, Germany, 102001.22, 0
            604, Spain, 12333.15, 0

        .. important::
            The labels in your csv **must** be integers that correctly index into the
            ``class_names`` array that you define (as shown below).
            E.g. 0 => 'Retained', 1 => 'Churned'

        Write the dataset config YAML file with the variables are needed by Openlayer:

        >>> import yaml
        >>>
        >> dataset_config = {
        ...     'columnNames': ['CreditScore', 'Geography', 'Balance', 'Churned'],
        ...     'classNames': ['Retained', 'Churned'],
        ...     'labelColumnName': 'Churned',
        ...     'label': 'training',  # or 'validation'
        ...     'featureNames': ['CreditScore', 'Geography', 'Balance'],
        ...     'categoricalFeatureNames': ['Geography'],
        ... }
        >>>
        >>> with open('/path/to/dataset_config.yaml', 'w') as f:
        ...     yaml.dump(dataset_config, f)

        You can now add this dataset to your project with:

        >>> project.add_dataset(
        ...     file_path='/path/to/dataset.csv',
        ...     dataset_config_file_path='/path/to/dataset_config.yaml',
        ... )

        After adding the dataset to the project, it is staged, waiting to
        be committed and pushed to the platform. You can check what's on
        your staging area with :obj:`status`. If you want to push the dataset
        right away with a commit message, you can use the :obj:`commit` and
        :obj:`push` methods:

        >>> project.commit("Initial dataset commit.")
        >>> project.push()

        **If your task type is text classification...**

        Let's say your dataset looks like the following:

        .. csv-table::
            :header: Text, Sentiment

            I have had a long weekend, 0
            I'm in a fantastic mood today, 1
            Things are looking up, 1

        >>>
        >>> with open('/path/to/dataset_config.yaml', 'w') as f:

        Notes
        -----
        - To use this method, you must first add a model and/or dataset to the staging area using one of the ``add`` methods (e.g., :obj:`add_model`, :obj:`add_dataset`, :obj:`add_dataframe`).

        Examples
        --------
        A commit message is associated with a project version. We have a new project version
        every time any of its resources (namely, model and/or dataset) are updated. The commit
        message is supposed to be a short description of the changes from one version to the next.

        Let's say you have a project with a model and a dataset staged. You can confirm these
        resources are indeed in the staging area using the :obj:`status` method:

        >>> project.status()
