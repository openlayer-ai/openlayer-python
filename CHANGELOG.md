## Unreleased

### Added
* Added `monitor_output_only` as an argument to the OpenAI `llm_monitor`. If set to `True`, the monitor will only record the output of the model, and not the input.

### Changed
* `llm_monitor` for OpenAI models now records the `cost` estimate and uploads it.

### Removed
* Deprecated and removed `publish_ground_truths` method. Use `update_data` instead.

## [0.1.0a20]

### Added
* Added `prompt` as an optional field in the config for LLM production data.
* `llm_monitor` for OpenAI ChatCompletion models records the `prompt` used and uploads it.
