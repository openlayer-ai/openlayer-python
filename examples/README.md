This repository contains a gallery of sample notebooks illustrating the process of **creating projects and uploading models & datasets** to the Openlayer platform.

## Why this repository exists?

This repository fulfills two main goals:

1. It demonstrates our Python API in action
2. It provides simple examples that may be similar to the problems you are solving at your organization.

We take privacy & security very seriously and understand that your models and datasets might contain sensitive or proprietary information. [Reach out to us](mailto:accounts@openlayer.com) if you are interested in our on-premise solution.

In the meantime, pick a task, model framework or problem that shares similarities with something you are working on and start exploring Openlayer right away!

## What is Openlayer?

Openlayer is a debugging workspace for ML & Data Science. Openlayer combines and builds upon SOTA techniques in explainability, model and dataset versioning, synthetic data generation, data-centric testing and much more to form a powerful, **unified platform for model development**.
