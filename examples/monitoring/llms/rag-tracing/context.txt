'Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs (1955â€“2011) and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak\'s Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company\'s second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called "1984". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.', 'History\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n1976â€“1980: Founding and incorporation\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. Â§\xa01971â€“1985: Jobs and Wozniak\nIn 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents\' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Although it is widely believed that the company was founded in the house\'s garage, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called it "a bit of a myth".[10] Jobs and Wozniak did, however, move some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\nApple\'s first product, the Apple I, designed by Steve Wozniak, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. The owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case.\nThe Apple II Plus, introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak', 'Guerrino De Luca\nPaul Deneve\nAl Eisenstat\nTony Fadell\nScott Forstall\nEllen Hancock\nNancy R.

"Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Most notably, enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.", '2007â€“2011: Success with mobile devices\nNewly announced iPhone on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called "a game changer for the industry".[114]', 'The success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.[60]The PenLite is Apple\'s first prototype of a tablet computer. Created in 1992, the project was designed to bring the Mac OS to a tablet â€“ but was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple\'s lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of their higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra models, the mid-range Centris line, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.[62]', "In May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100\xa0million units sold within six years.[96]\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99Â¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]"

'On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6\xa0million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September\xa03, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100\xa0million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300\xa0millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778\xa0billion.[30][31]', 'As of August\xa03, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1\xa0trillion market value.[284][285] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[286]\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[287]', "Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1\xa0trillion in August 2018, then at $2\xa0trillion in August 2020, and at $3\xa0trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3\xa0trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.", '^ Bagnall, Brian (2005).
